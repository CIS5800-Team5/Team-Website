## **Our Project**

These days, many individuals have multiple subscriptions that they pay a monthly fee for. Companies like Spotify, Pandora, YouTube and Amazon Prime make it very easy to sign up for their services. You sign up, insert your credit card information and the service will automatically charge each month (or other specified interval). But things come up. Another video streaming service comes along with a show you can't resist watching or the series you signed up to watch has come to an end or you've lost interest. Not a problem, because you're still being billed, right?

But what if there was one place to track all your subscriptions in one place and decide for yourself if you would like to continue using them? 

***SubTracker*** is a subscription tracking management system. It allows a user to track their subscription services as a way to visualize how much they are spending monthly. If you're spending too much, we'll provide guidance on canceling services. Or what if you have so many subscription services you don't know whch one to use when you're just looking to couch surf... stop by your portal and get direct links to each subscription service in your list.

## **Our Management Tools**

To track the work we're doing, we'll be using [Azure DevOps Boards](https://dev.azure.com/CIS5800-Team5/SubTracker/_workitems/recentlyupdated). We'll be working in Sprints to complete tasks on time. We'll also be using [GitHub](https://github.com/CIS5800-Team5) to share code for our [Frontend Application](https://github.com/CIS5800-Team5/SubTracker-Frontend) and [Backend Application](https://github.com/CIS5800-Team5/SubTracker-Backend).
