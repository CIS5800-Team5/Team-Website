# Desmond Lee

I like analytical thinking and finding different ways to solve problems and ways to tackle opportunities.  
I have an agile mindset and have developed a verification system for a club that was necessary after past club incidents as well as adaptation due to COVID-19.  

I am the Frontend Designer (UI/UX) for SubTracker. While this may be fairly new to me, I am willing to work on the new skills and technologies with my team.  

I have some experience with:
* Python
* C++
* SQL
* HTML
* CSS
