# Jason Semon ðŸ˜Ž

I am passionate about technology and particularly enjoy Linux and Open Source Technologies. I enjoy learning about new trends in technology to work more efficiently and see progress and success. I believe in the "Automate yourself out of a job" mantra as it helps everyone develop new skills.

I have experience with an extensive number of platforms, tools and languages:
* GitHub
* Jenkins
* AWS (EC2, IAM, S3, EFS)
* CentOS & RHEL (4/5/6/7)
* NginX
* Bash
* Azure DevOps
* Python
* PHP
* Powershell
* Azure AD
* Jira
* Confluence

What makes me unique is my ability to provide guidance in many areas, from Infrastructure (hardware, cloud), Infrastructure as code, Automated deployments and reverse engineering workflows in order to automate the repetive, day-to-day operational tasks.
